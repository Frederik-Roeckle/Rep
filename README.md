(eds) Business Process Management. BPM 2023. Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol 14159. Springer, Cham. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-41620-0_24

## Steps to recreate the CSV files

To recreate the CSV files saved in the [Complexity Data](https://github.com/MaxVidgof/complexity-data) repository by the authors follow the following steps.

### 1 Download Event Log files

Download all the original event log files used by the authors.

- [BPI Challenge 2015](https://data.4tu.nl/collections/_/5065424/1)
- [Real-life event logs - Hospital log](https://data.4tu.nl/articles/_/12716513/1)
- [BPI challenge 2017](https://data.4tu.nl/articles/_/12696884/1)
- [BPI challenge 2019](https://data.4tu.nl/articles/_/12715853/1)
- [BPI challenge 2020](https://data.4tu.nl/collections/_/5065541/1)
- [BPI challenge 2018](https://data.4tu.nl/articles/_/12688355/1)

After that, unzip them and find the XES files. For example, event log file for BPI challenge 2017 is located in `BPI Challenge 2017_1_all.zip/BPI Challenge 2017.xes.gz/BPIChallenge2017.xes`

### 2 Make sure latest version of pm4py is installed

It is possible that installed pm4py version is not the recent one. For older version of pm4py, Python scripts in the project [process-complexity](https://github.com/MaxVidgof/process-complexity) (provided by Paper authors) will throw errors.

Execute `python -m pip freeze` to check the version of installed pm4py package. If the pm4py version is not latest uninstall the package and reinstall again.

`python -m pip uninstall pm4py`
`python -m pip install -Iv pm4py==2.7.11.4`

### 3 Prepare the metrices (CSV files)

To preprae the metrices for the dowloaded event log files, we need to execute the Python scripts from the [process-complexity](https://github.com/MaxVidgof/process-complexity) project. Following are the steps for metrices preparation.

- Clone the project from Github.
- After cloning, open the command promt and set working director to the cloned directory. i.e. execute `cd D:\Python\APMProject\process-complexity`
- Now execute the **montlhy.py** script to generate metrics for a given event log file. To save the metrics as a file, use `--save-csv` option. i.e. execute `python .\monthly.py -f "D:\BPI Challenge 2017_1_all\BPI Challenge 2017.xes\BPIChallenge2017.xes" --save-csv`. This will create a file named BPIChallenge2017_metrics.csv. Generated csv file contains less number of columns than the original **merged.csv** file (in the project [Complexity Data](https://github.com/MaxVidgof/complexity-data)).
- Use **over_time.py** script to generate exactly similar csv files with more columns. Example command to execute - `python .\over-time.py -f "D:\BPI Challenge 2017_1_all\BPI Challenge 2017.xes\BPIChallenge2017.xes"`. Note that, *--save-csv* is not needed here.

### 4 Merging all CSV files

After generating all the CSV files using **over_time.py** script, we need to merge them in a single file. That file will be similar to the **merged.csv** file in the project [Complexity Data](https://github.com/MaxVidgof/complexity-data).

We registered that there are some minor floating differences between our calculations and the ones from the author.
